This project is a study project which shows a clear background architecture with Granite and some CRUD react example, with HOC's.


The background is architected using the Granite architecture, where the actions encapsulate the business logic and the input validation.


It uses Rails 5.2 and Granite.

The authorization is done via pundit, and the gateway toward the HTTP API is GRAPE with Swagger.

Everything is covered with Rspecs.
